        <div>
            <p>Goodreads is a widely popular web-based social platform specifically made for readers.
                It is primarily used for reviewing and rating literary works, getting book recommendations 
                and tracking books that one wants to read, is reading or has read. An evaluation of the usability 
                of the running version of Goodreads.com was conducted on 26th to 29th September 2020.

        <h3>Summary of study</h3>
        <p>A total of 6 users were recruited through a screener questionnaire to participate in a live usability test 
            and our Optimal Workshop Treejack Test. Another 14 users were recruited to participate solely in the treejack test.
            The target user of Goodreads.com is book-readers. 
        </p>
            
        <p>The live usability test sessions were conducted remotely due to the imposed COVID-19 restrictions. 
            Tools used for the study include Zoom, Loop11 and Optimal Workshop. This suite of tools allowed the 
            group to perform user observation as normal. All users participated in the test from their homes, 
            and during the session, we encouraged them to use the think-aloud method, and speak their thoughts 
            while completing tasks.
        </p>

        <p>The study aims to uncover underlying usability issues within the site, and suggest potential solutions and 
            recommendations to further improve the user experience of the site by gathering qualitative and quantitative 
            data from our usability test sessions and treejack study. Our usability goals are derived from Quesenbery’s 5Es 
            (2004) - Efficient, effective, engaging, error-tolerant, easy to learn.</p>
        
        <p>Participants for our live usability test sessions were given 5 tasks to complete, while asked to “think out loud”, 
            which is to verbalising and describing their thoughts during the tasks. The tasks were presented to them through 
            imaginary scenarios. They were asked to fill out a post-task questionnaire after every task. At the end of the session, 
            participants completed the System Usability Scale questionnaire. Each usability test lasted around 35 minutes on average.</p>
        
        <p>Goodreads is a site optimised for regular readers and technology users. Users had positive comments about the 
            rating controls, search bar and the ‘Ask the Author’ feature during the usability test session.</p>
        
        <p>However, the site scored a SUS score of 45 out of 100 according to our users. The study revealed certain aspects of the 
            site impeded their ability to succeed at the tasks. These included (1) information architecture, (2) visual design and 
            layout, and (3) conciseness of content.</p>

        <div>
            <h4>Information architecture:</h4>
            <p>The	current	site	structure	is	convoluted	and	the	
                navigation	bar	hasn’t	been	optimised	to	help	
                users	navigate.</p>
            <p>Recommendation: Design	a	page	that	lets	users	browse	
                preview	content	of	each	page.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Visual design & layout:</h4>
            <p>The	poorly	designed	laid	out	buttons,	links,	and	
                textual	content	of	the	site	affect	users’	ability	to	
                complete	tasks	on	the	site.</p>
            <p>Recommendations: Simplify	and	standardise	page	layout,	place	
                focus	on	buttons	and	controls & implement	a	style	guide.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h4>Conciseness	of	content:</h4>
            <p>Users	were	overwhelmed	by	the	amount	of	
                content	on	the	pages.</p>
            <p>Recommendations: Enlarge	book	covers, remove	excess	text	on	page,	use	more	
                concise	wording & group	similar	genres	together</p>
