# web-portfolio

I have created this portfolio as a part of THTR30004 Hashtag Cyberstar.

Throughout my degree I have worked on various projects related to web design, user interface design (UI) and studied usability (UX). This website will showcase these projects that I have worked on throughout my university degree, acting as a portfolio. I hope this portfolio will assist me in getting job and internship opportunities.

Furthermore, I am majoring in Digital Technologies in the Bachelor of Design. The creation of this site will help me continue develop my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills, as well as a be a project in itself where I can implement the UX and UI skills I have gained over the past three years studying design. I will be coding this website from scratch, so this website will act as an example of my web development skills.
